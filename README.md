My major learnings while working through this project.

See below:

```html
<button class="learn-more-sedans">Learn More</button>
```

```css
.learn-more-sedans:hover {
  background-color: var(--yellow);
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all 0.1s ease-in-out;
  border: 0.1rem solid var(--transparent-white-paragraphs);
  color: var(--transparent-white-paragraphs);
}
```
